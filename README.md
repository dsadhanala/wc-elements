# web component elements (wc-elements)
Playground to experiment with web components, I'll be using this repo to self learn and experiment with web components. My goal is to create components using web standards and create reusable elements.

## Todo
- Create repos for each component once it is in complete state and added them as submodules, to list and preview here.
- Add documentation and unit testing for each component.
- Create ES6 version of importable JS only custom element along with HTML imports for each element.
